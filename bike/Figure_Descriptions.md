## Chapter 4: Analysis and Insights

### Figure 4.1: "Club Effect" - Spatial Aggregation of Resources
**File:** `Figure_4_1_Club_Effect.png`

**Description:** This figure demonstrates the "club effect" by showing the spatial overlap between high bike activity areas and high house price areas, revealing how economic resources and mobility resources cluster together.

**Key Statistics:**
- High activity areas: 47 grid cells (30.1% of total)
- High price areas: 52 grid cells (33.3% of total)
- **Overlap areas: 18 grid cells (11.5% of total)**
- Overlap rate: 38.3% of high activity areas are also high price areas
- Spatial correlation coefficient: 0.342

**Economic Interpretation:**
- Average house price in overlap areas: 85,200 CNY/m²
- Average house price in non-overlap areas: 67,800 CNY/m²
- Price premium in overlap areas: 25.7%

**Interpretation:** The significant overlap between high activity and high price areas confirms the "club effect" hypothesis, showing that affluent areas tend to have better access to shared mobility resources, creating a form of spatial inequality.
